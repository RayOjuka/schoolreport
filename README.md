# Schoolreport

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.4.
A school sent the data in the data.json file to a parent. The parent couldnâ€™t quite understand how to interpret the
data. Using either Angular or AngularJS, graphs, tables and any other UI elements, create a page (plus any other
pages as you may see fit) that will present the data in the most intuitive way, making it easier for the parent to
understand it. Let your solution show your creativity.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
